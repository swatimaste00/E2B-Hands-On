# Build Events-to-Business Actions Scenarios with SAP BTP and Microsoft Azure - testing

[![REUSE status](https://api.reuse.software/badge/github.com/SAP-samples/btp-events-to-business-actions-framework)](https://api.reuse.software/info/github.com/SAP-samples/btp-events-to-business-actions-framework)

This repository contains code samples and instructions for developing an extension application in SAP BTP. The sample application has been developed in a partner collaboration to help customers integrate any type of events from systems into SAP ecosystem via SAP BTP. This application helps to configure  actions that needs to be taken in SAP LoB systems based on the events that is received in SAP Integration Suite, Advanced Event Mesh. The application scenario you will develop in this tutorial leverages Event-To-Business actions framework (extension application). 

This framework can be used in combination with any hyperscalar/telco IoT.

## Scenario

The business scenario you will be implementing how to integrate real time events generated from Microsoft Azure IoT Platform into SAP business processes to enrich the outcome of enterprise operations and facilitate rapid decision making. The framework can be extended to any platform and to any kind of event.

You can choose to configure and integrate events with any SAP LoB solution.

## Business Process Flow

In this event-driven scenario, based on the real-time status of the IoT Devices , actionable events are sent to SAP BTP to decide on the critical business actions to be taken in the SAP Enteprise Business systems based on business rules defined in the system.

1. Data from IoT Devices are sent to Microsoft Azure IoT Central.

2. Rules in Microsoft Azure IoT triggers an call to SAP Integration Suite, Advanced Event Mesh in case of any actions which needs attention. This is defined in IoT Rules for devices.

3. SAP Integration Suite, Advanced Event Mesh receives the events.

4. Extension application is configured with all necessary actions (For example, calling SAP Build Process Automation - Decisions capability API to read the decision tables to decide on action to be taken, configure the OData API call to be executed , service call back to the device) to be taken.

5. Extension application executes the business actions.

6. For this sample application, based on the fill level of waste container/silo a new Purchase Order Requisition is created in SAP S/4HANA.

## Solution Architecture


The key services used from Microsoft Azure are the Azure IoT Central, Azure Blob Storage, Azure Communication Service, Azure Event Grid and Azure Active Directory.

The services used from SAP BTP are the Cloud Foundry Runtime, SAP Advanced Event Mesh, SAP Build Process Automation Decisions capability, SAP Connectivity service, SAP Private Link service, SAP Workflow Management and SAP Destination service. 

SAP Private Link service is used for connectivity between SAP BTP and SAP S/4HANA when both the systems are running on Microsoft Azure Infrastructure. In this tutorial you will find implementation steps for SAP BTP Private Link service and Microsoft Azure Private Link service. Alternatively you can use SAP Connectivity service and Cloud Connector for integration of SAP BTP and SAP S/4HANA as well.

The following steps depicts the information flow across systems (in both the scenarios)

(1) Event is triggered from Microsoft Azure and sent to SAP Integration Suite, Advanced Event Mesh.

(2) Event-to-Business-Action framework(extension app) processor module's endpoint is subscribed to SAP Integration Suite, Advanced Event Mesh, hence receives this event.

(3) Event-to-Business-Action framework(extension app) processor module leverages the Decisions capability of SAP Build Process Automation to derive business action (for example, Purchase Order Requisition creation in SAP S/4HANA system) based on certain characteristics of incoming event.

(4), (5), (6) (7) and (8) Event-to-Business-Action framework (extension app) processor module triggers the defined action in the SAP S/4HANA system by using the SAP Destination Service and SAP Private Link Service.  

For more information, see [Set Up Connectivity Between SAP BTP and SAP S/4HANA Using SAP Private Link Service](./Documentation/Scenario1-Inbound-to-SAPS4HANA/Step4b-Setup-SAPPrivateLinkService/README.md) page.

In case SAP S/4HANA is on-premise and private cloud (refer to Figure-2)â€“ communication with SAP S/4 HANA integrates via SAP Connectivity Service and Cloud Connector.

(9) and (10) SAP S/4HANA publishes event for Purchase Requisition creation is sent to Microsoft Azure Event Grid via SAP Event Mesh Connectivity Bridge for further processing by Microfost Azure applications.

For outbound from SAP S/4HANA scenario using SAP Integration Suite, Advanced Event Mesh Connectivity Plan(Beta), see [Integrate Events Between SAP and Microsoft using SAP Event Mesh - Connectivity Bridge Service](https://github.com/SAP-samples/btp-event-mesh-connectivity-bridge) page. You will find the detailed architecture and business scenario for SAP Integration Suite, Advanced Event Mesh and Azure Event Grid direct connectivity.

## Disclaimer

This project has been a proof of concept, including several limitations and prerequisites. The objective was to build a extension application for receiving and automating the actions in SAP S/4HANA. For this reason, the coding should not be seen as any recommendation for productive implementation. It fulfils the purpose and requirements of a proof of concept and is not intended for productive usage. It has been declared as pure proof of concept only to give the development teams ideas for solving potential challenges when integrating events from other platforms and SAP S/4HANA using SAP BTP. This can be extended to integrate with any other SAP LoB system as well.
