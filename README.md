# IN263 - Support Industry 4.0 with Event-Driven Architecture   

## Description    

This repository contains the material for the SAP TechEd 2023 session called IN263 - Support Industry 4.0 with Event-Driven Architecture.

## Overview  

This session introduces attendees to a event-driven Industry 4.0 business scenario where they will implement Events-to-Business-Actions framework built on SAP BTP to integrate real time events generated from Microsoft Azure IoT Central into SAP Business Processes to enrich the outcome of enterprise operations and facilitate rapid decision making. This Events-to-Business-Actions framework can be used in combination with any hyperscaler or telco IoT.

## Business Process Flow

In this event-driven scenario, based on the real-time status of the IoT Devices , actionable events are sent to SAP BTP to decide on the critical business actions to be taken in the SAP Enteprise Business systems based on business rules defined in the system.

-   Data from industrial IoT Devices are sent to Microsoft Azure IoT Central.   
-   Rules in Microsoft Azure IoT identifies any event which needs attention and forwards it to SAP Integration Suite Advanced Event Mesh.
-   SAP Integration Suite, Advanced Event Mesh receives the events and triggers webhook to send the events to extension application of Events-to-Business-Actions framework running on SAP BTP.
-   Extension application of Events-To-Business-Actions framework is configured with all necessary actions to be taken.
   -    (Default Action) Calling SAP Build Process Automation - Decision capability API to determine which business action to be taken
   -    (Main Action) execute the business action OData API call to trigger business process in ERP systems
   -    (Pre Action) call api to get master data required for business action api (Main Action)
   -    (Post Action) After business action is executed, call Azure IoT device api to update it's status.
   Extension application executes the business actions and any pre or post actions.

In today's hand-on session, Based on the fill level of waste container/silo a new Purchase Order Requisition is created in SAP S/4HANA.
   -   Simulate a Waste Container device in IOT Azure central which constantly generates events.
   -   Set up a rule which identifies when waste container is close to filled and forwards the event to Advanced Event Mesh uisng detinations in Azure IOT Central.
   -   Advanced Event Mesh triggers the webhook to forward the event to Events-to-Business-Actions framework.
   -   Events-to-Business-Actions-Framework will first identify that a Purchase Requisition needs to be created in SAP S/4 HANA using Decision from SAP Build Process Automation and then creates a Purchase Requisition in SAP S/4 HANA system. Once purchase requisitionn is created, it also update the Waste Container device status on Azure IoT Central.

## Solution Architecture


The key services used from Microsoft Azure are the Azure IoT Central, Azure Blob Storage, Azure Communication Service, Azure Event Grid and Azure Active Directory.

The services used from SAP BTP are the Cloud Foundry Runtime, SAP Advanced Event Mesh, SAP Build Process Automation Decisions capability, SAP Connectivity service, SAP Private Link service, SAP Workflow Management and SAP Destination service. 

SAP Private Link service is used for connectivity between SAP BTP and SAP S/4HANA when both the systems are running on Microsoft Azure Infrastructure. In this tutorial you will find implementation steps for SAP BTP Private Link service and Microsoft Azure Private Link service. Alternatively you can use SAP Connectivity service and Cloud Connector for integration of SAP BTP and SAP S/4HANA as well.

![plot](./images/SolutionArcCloudConnector.png) **Figure-2: High-level architecture with SAP S/4HANA on-premise and private cloud**

The following steps depicts the information flow across systems (in both the scenarios)

(1) Event is triggered from Microsoft Azure and sent to SAP Integration Suite, Advanced Event Mesh.

(2) Event-to-Business-Action framework(extension app) processor module's endpoint is subscribed to SAP Integration Suite, Advanced Event Mesh, hence receives this event.

(3) Event-to-Business-Action framework(extension app) processor module leverages the Decisions capability of SAP Build Process Automation to derive business action (for example, Purchase Order Requisition creation in SAP S/4HANA system) based on certain characteristics of incoming event.

(4), (5), (6) (7) and (8) Event-to-Business-Action framework (extension app) processor module triggers the defined action in the SAP S/4HANA system by using the SAP Destination Service and SAP Private Link Service.  

For more information, see [Set Up Connectivity Between SAP BTP and SAP S/4HANA Using SAP Private Link Service](./Documentation/Scenario1-Inbound-to-SAPS4HANA/Step4b-Setup-SAPPrivateLinkService/README.md) page.

In case SAP S/4HANA is on-premise and private cloud (refer to Figure-2)â€“ communication with SAP S/4 HANA integrates via SAP Connectivity Service and Cloud Connector.

(9) and (10) SAP S/4HANA publishes event for Purchase Requisition creation is sent to Microsoft Azure Event Grid via SAP Event Mesh Connectivity Bridge for further processing by Microfost Azure applications.

For outbound from SAP S/4HANA scenario using SAP Integration Suite, Advanced Event Mesh Connectivity Plan(Beta), see [Integrate Events Between SAP and Microsoft using SAP Event Mesh - Connectivity Bridge Service](https://github.com/SAP-samples/btp-event-mesh-connectivity-bridge) page. You will find the detailed architecture and business scenario for SAP Integration Suite, Advanced Event Mesh and Azure Event Grid direct connectivity.

## Disclaimer

This project has been a proof of concept, including several limitations and prerequisites. The objective was to build a extension application for receiving and automating the actions in SAP S/4HANA. For this reason, the coding should not be seen as any recommendation for productive implementation. It fulfils the purpose and requirements of a proof of concept and is not intended for productive usage. It has been declared as pure proof of concept only to give the development teams ideas for solving potential challenges when integrating events from other platforms and SAP S/4HANA using SAP BTP. This can be extended to integrate with any other SAP LoB system as well.
